<h1>Meredith De Olavarria, Founder</h1>
<div>
Meredith De Olavarria was a frequent traveler and faced challenges to accommodate her
 then 13-year-old miniature schnauzer, Leslie. Kennels weren't an option because Leslie 
 was diagnosed with various pancreatitis issues. As she grew older, she needed more care
 and attention. Meredith wanted Leslie to be comfortable in her own familiar environment while 
 being cared for. Back then, there weren't any formal pet sitting companies in and around the 
 Houston area. Hence, Meredith had to depend on friends and family which became a burden for them 
 over time. It was in 2002 that Meredith decided to start a pet sitting service called Urban Pet
  Sitting to help many pet owners like her to travel without worries.
