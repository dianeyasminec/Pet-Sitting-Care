<h1>Loving Care When You Can't Be There</h1>

    <span>Dawn</span>
    <p>
    Our country/city girl has always had a deep love and passion for every kind of
     animal in the world from rabbits to dogs, cats, and even chickens at the farm. 
     At one time she had 20 box turtles! For as long as she can remember, Dawn has
      been caring for pets. She has a passion for animal rescue and caring for injured 
      animals. After being a stay at home mom with her three now grown kids, she enjoys
       Houston's international restaurant scene and traveling in her free time.

    <p>
   After recently serving overseas in the US Navy, Dayana came back to Houston and 
   discovered her true passion working with animals. With two beloved cats of her own,
    she finds it uplifting coming home to pets that will be there for you to make every
     day a bit better. She firmly believes no love is bigger than pets' love for their humans.
      A true team player who enjoys hands-on jobs, Dayana has also served as a member of our
       Urban Housekeeping team.
